					I am a Spartan majoring in Computer Science Engineering. I was born in Egypt, but lived most of my life in the Arabian gulf area. I still don't know what my calling is, but from Computer Science to Social International Development, I have a wide variety of academic passions. Even in Art, I have taken a particular liking to capturing the local splendors of life through painting and photography. In addition, I am a very religious person. As a Coptic (Egyptian) Orthodox Christian, much of my life is centered on God. Seeking and journeying alongside him has been the driving force of many of my life goals, and I’ve found that there’s always more to learn. A few years ago, “knowledge seeker” would have been the term to describe myself and my path was left without a purpose or focus to give it meaning. Back then, my interests were extremely vague, and I found myself with the desire to become an educated and respected man. Today, however, there is both a spiritual dimension and a set purpose to my journey. This purpose has aims of learning not only the treasures of knowledge in this world, but also of the spiritual world—where my joy is complete in seeking God.
